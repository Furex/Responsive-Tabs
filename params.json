The values 'tabs' and 'accordion' can be used to make the panels collapsible in a specific view/state. If a tab is active and you select it again, the panel will collapse.\r\n\r\n        collapsible: false // The panels are not collapsible\r\n        collapsible: true // The panels are collapsible\r\n        collapsible: 'tabs' // The panels are only collapsible if the view is currently tab based\r\n        collapsible: 'accordion' // The panels are only collapsible if the view is currently accordion based\r\n\r\n### Start collapsed\r\nThis option defines if the first panel on load starts collapsed or not. With the values 'tabs' and 'accordion' you can specify in which view the tabs are supposed to start collapsed.\r\n\r\n        startCollapsed: false // Do not collapse on start\r\n        startCollapsed: true // Start with the panels collapsed\r\n        startCollapsed: 'tabs' // Start with the panels collapsed if the view is currently tab based\r\n        startCollapsed: 'accordion' // Start with the panels collapsed if the view is currently accordion based\r\n\r\n### Active tab\r\nAn 0 based integer that defines the initial opened tab on load.\r\n\r\n        active: 1 // Opens the second tab on load\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rotate\r\nThis option can be used to auto rotate the tabs. The tabs will stop rotating when a tab is selected.\r\n\r\n        rotate: false, // The tabs won't auto rotate\r\n        rotate: true, // The tabs will auto rotate from the start\r\n\r\n### Animation\r\nThis option enables the animation of the panels. By default the panels will just show and hide, this option can be used to make the panels slide up and down and fade in and out.\r\n\r\n        animation: 'fade', // The panels will fade in and out\r\n        animation: 'slide', // The panels will slide up and down\r\n\r\nCallbacks\r\n---------\r\n\r\n### Activate\r\nThis callback is called after a tab is selected\r\n\r\n        activate: function(){},\r\n\r\n### Deactivate\r\nThis callback is called after a tab is deactivated\r\n\r\n        deactivate: function(){},\r\n\r\n### Load\r\nThis callback is called after the plugin has been loaded\r\n\r\n        load: function(){},\r\n\r\n### Activate State\r\nThis callback is called after the plugin switches from state (Tab view / Accordion view)\r\n\r\n        activateState: function(){}\r\n\r\nToDo\r\n====\r\nI am planning on adding these options in the future:\r\n- Ajax panels\r\n- Tabs that can be disabled\r\n- Keyboard interaction\r\n- Selection event type (for instance, mouseover)\r\n\r\nIf you have good ideas / tips about options / functionality, let me know!\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=========\r\nThe idea for this plugin is based on 'Easy Responsive Tabs to Accordion' by samsono (github.com/samsono)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/samsono/Easy-Responsive-Tabs-to-Accordion\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n=======\r\nIf you have any questions, problems or suggestions, feel free to submit a ticket!\r\n\r\nBuy me a beer!\r\n==============\r\nIf you enjoy this plugin and like to make a donation you can use the button below :).\r\n\r\n[![Buy me a beer](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=jelle%40jellekralt%2enl&lc=NL&item_name=Jelle%20Kralt&item_number=responsive%2dtabs&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n=======\r\nMIT: http://jellekralt.mit-license.org/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
